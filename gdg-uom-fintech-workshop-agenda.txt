------------------------------------------------------------
WORKSHOP OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------
A normal API handles data. A fintech API handles money and legal responsibility.
Students will learn why fintech APIs require security, compliance, fraud controls,
ledger entries, and auditability in a single request flow.

------------------------------------------------------------
WHO SHOULD ATTEND
------------------------------------------------------------
- Computer Science Year 1-2 students
- Students with basic REST/HTTP understanding
- Anyone curious about backend systems and fintech engineering

------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------------------------
- What an API is
- Basic HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- JSON format
- Basic Node.js concepts

------------------------------------------------------------
LEARNING OUTCOMES
------------------------------------------------------------
After this workshop, students will be able to:
- Explain how fintech APIs differ from regular APIs
- Understand idempotency and why it prevents double charges
- Understand basic compliance and fraud concepts
- Test and run a local payment API project
- Read and follow a backend request flow end-to-end

------------------------------------------------------------
AGENDA AND TIMELINE (90 MINUTES)
------------------------------------------------------------
0:00 - 0:10  | Opening and context
             | - Why payment APIs are different from general APIs
             | - Real-world risk: money, regulation, and trust

0:10 - 0:25 | Core concepts
             | - Validation and request safety
             | - Idempotency and retry behavior
             | - Compliance checks (KYC/AML) and fraud screening

0:25 - 0:45 | Architecture walkthrough
             | - Request workflow: Router -> Controller -> Validation
             |   -> Idempotency -> Compliance/Fraud -> Ledger -> Audit -> Response
             | - Why audit logs and ledger entries matter in production

0:45 - 1:05 | Live coding and demo (repo walkthrough)
             | - Run local API
             | - Execute payment request
             | - Replay same request with same Idempotency-Key
             | - Verify no duplicate side effects

1:05 - 1:20 | New module: AI fraud detection with Gemini
             | - Add AI-assisted fraud scoring for transaction review
             | - Use Gemini to classify suspicious payment patterns
             | - Example output: approve / manual_review / decline recommendation
             | - Discuss guardrails: explainability, false positives, audit trail

1:20 - 1:30 | Q and A + student challenge
             | - Students test scenarios and compare outcomes
             | - Follow-up tasks and repository exercises

------------------------------------------------------------
NEW SECTION TO ADD IN WEB + REPO (POST-WORKSHOP UPDATE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Section Name:
AI Fraud Detection with Gemini

Recommended Scope:
- Endpoint extension for fraud decision support
- Prompt template for risk signals (velocity, amount anomalies, patterns)
- Structured AI response schema (risk score + reason + recommendation)
- Human-in-the-loop final decision for high-risk cases
- Logging AI decision context into audit trail

Student-Friendly Deliverable:
- Simple demo request that triggers Gemini fraud analysis
- Clear output fields for students to inspect
- README instructions to run and test locally

------------------------------------------------------------
EXPECTED IMPACT FOR GDG STUDENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Practical understanding of secure fintech backend engineering
- Exposure to real architecture patterns used in regulated environments
- Clear bridge between classic API development and AI-assisted risk controls
- Portfolio-ready project experience with production-style concepts
