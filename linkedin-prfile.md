AboutAbout
I am a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience in battling computing challenges. My journey started as a BackEnd developer researcher and programmer, where I honed my craft at top-tier companies like Avrioc Technologies, Index Holding, AT Tech, S3 Technology, and some bleeding-edge startups.

What excites me the most in this field is the opportunity to create powerful abstractions that elegantly solve difficult computing problems. I have extensive expertise in PHP frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and WordPress, and JavaScript frameworks like Vue, Node.js, and Nest.js, which are my current favorites. Additionally, I enjoy tinkering with projects that integrate Neural Networks, AI, and cloud computing in my spare time.

As a Senior BackEnd developer, I specialize in application development and database design. My exceptional technical skills and ability to learn quickly allow me to excel in delivering efficient and reliable solutions to complex problems. Moreover, my strong communication and collaboration skills help me work independently or collaboratively with my team to achieve results.

If you are looking for a passionate software engineer who can deliver elegant solutions to complex computing problems, then I would be an excellent addition to your team. With my extensive experience, expertise in frameworks, and exceptional communication skills.

I significantly enhanced the ProConvey web application, a leading platform for property conveyancing. I implemented key features to streamline the onboarding process for new conveyancers and improve the overall conveyancing experience.

Throughout the development process, I utilised a full-stack approach, leveraging both front-end and back-end technologies. On the front-end, I worked on React.js and TypeScript for building user interfaces and managing application state. For the back-end, Laravel (PHP) used to construct secure and scalable APIs. Additionally, implemented GraphQL to facilitate efficient data fetching and manipulation.

My contributions focused on several key areas. First, I designed and implemented an improved onboarding process for new conveyancers. This included features like adding customisable email templates, allowing them to personalise communication with clients from the outset. Second, I developed a interface for conveyancer protocol forms. This streamlined data collection and ensured accuracy, while also enabling the automatic generation of PDFs for these forms. Third, integrated Yoti, a secure document signing solution, to enhance the security and convenience of the conveyancing process.

Furthermore, I have worked on Sprift API to seamlessly retrieve property details based on UPRN. This eliminated manual data entry and ensured property information accuracy. The API integration also facilitated the management of property images within the platform. Finally, I created a document pack generation section. This section allows users to generate different types of documents with granular permission control and automated naming conventions, improving document organisation and accessibility.

This project showcases my proficiency in various technologies, including React.js, TypeScript, Laravel (PHP), GraphQL, Laravel features like Jobs and Queues, and React state management.

Verofy is a next‑generation payments platform that empowers SMEs with enterprise‑grade infrastructure, lightning‑fast transactions, and seamless integrations—all wrapped in a customer‑first experience. As part of the core engineering team, I’m helping build the full suite of solutions, including real‑time merchant onboarding, AI‑driven fraud detection, ePOS connectivity, simplified PCI compliance, and next‑day settlement capabilities.

I designed and rolled out a machine‑decisioning onboarding engine that slashed merchant approval times from days to minutes, then development of the AI‑driven Fraud AI Sentinel to catch and block suspicious transactions in real time. To streamline in‑store checkouts, I built Verofy Connect—a bi‑directional bridge between third‑party ePOS systems and our Verofy Move terminals—eliminating manual‑entry errors and accelerating workflows.

On the compliance and settlement side, I created the PCI+ toolkit to embed PCI DSS checks and reporting directly into the platform, and engineered RESTful APIs for next‑day funding to optimize SME cash flow. These innovations drove a 90 % reduction in onboarding cycles, cut chargeback losses significantly within the first quarter, delivered 99.99 % terminal uptime over 4G/Wi‑Fi, and reduced PCI audit prep time by 75 %.

The ProConvey web application underwent significant enhancements aimed at optimising property conveyancing processes. Key features were introduced to streamline the onboarding journey for new conveyancers, enhancing the overall conveyancing experience.

Utilising a comprehensive full-stack approach, we integrated front-end and back-end technologies. Front-end development involved leveraging React.js and TypeScript to construct user interfaces and manage application state. On the back-end, we utilised Laravel (PHP) to develop secure and scalable APIs, complemented by GraphQL for efficient data fetching and manipulation.

Our contributions were focused on pivotal areas. Firstly, redesigned and implemented an enhanced onboarding process, featuring customisable email templates to personalise client communication from the outset. Secondly, developed an intuitive interface for conveyancer protocol forms, facilitating streamlined data collection and automatic PDF generation for enhanced accuracy.

Additionally, seamlessly integrated Yoti, a secure document signing solution, to bolster the security and convenience of the conveyancing process. Leveraging the Sprift API, enabled seamless retrieval of property details based on UPRN, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring data accuracy. The API integration also facilitated efficient management of property images within the platform.

Furthermore, introduced a document pack generation section, empowering users to generate various document types with granular permission control and automated naming conventions, thereby enhancing document organisation and accessibility.

This project serves as a testament to our proficiency in a myriad of technologies, including React.js, TypeScript, Laravel (PHP), GraphQL, as well as Laravel features like Jobs and Queues, and React state management.

The Maestro is designed to handle large volumes of data and user interactions in real-time. It allows to host multiple events in a highly scalable and efficient way.

The project is built using Laravel, which is a PHP web framework that provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications. Laravel is known for its elegant syntax, ease of use, and scalability. It's also highly customizable, making it a great choice for complex projects.

MySQL is used as the primary database management system for the project, storing user data, events, and other important information. MySQL is a reliable and scalable database system that ensures data consistency and integrity, even in high-traffic environments.

The project's architecture enables real-time updates and notifications. When a user performs an action, such as creating a post or sending a message, an event is triggered. This event can be used to notify other users who are following that user, update the user's feed with the new post or message, and perform other actions as needed.

The event-based architecture ensures that all relevant components of the project are updated in real-time, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. It also enables developers to build highly scalable and efficient applications that can handle large volumes of data and user interactions.

Overall, the Maestro built using Laravel and MySQL is a powerful and scalable solution for handling large volumes of data and user interactions in real-time. With its event-based architecture and powerful technology stack, it can be used to build a wide range of applications, from social media platforms to real-time messaging systems.

EZ DOC – AN EASY WAY TO REDUCE GP ADMIN
Admin staff can be empowered to be the first point of contact for all clinical correspondence, reducing admin time for GPs from one hour to approximately 10 minutes a day.

On average, an individual GP may spend up to two hours a day dealing with correspondence and associated administrative tasks. Not only is this highly inefficient, but it can be quite demoralizing when GPs are consistently leaving the practice one or two hours after the doors have closed.

AT Medics has created EZ Doc, a bespoke training and support product that can transform the way we handle the huge amount of correspondence arriving into our practices every day. This solution has been developed and extensively tested by AT Medics Lead GPs as a response to the increasing burden of administrative workload. The team are experts in Primary Care, Primary Care IT systems and Data Management. As London’s largest primary care provider, they uniquely experienced in deploying and implementing new systems at scale, in a wide variety of GP settings.
EZ Doc is currently being used successfully in over 30 surgeries across 16 London CCGs.

I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Kamran Khalid at Verofy Ltd, where he serves as a Senior Backend Developer and is my direct point of contact for backend API integration. Kamran is the person I turn to for guidance, technical direction, and best practices when implementing backend services into our frontend systems.
He is responsible for architecting and implementing robust APIs, managing deployments, ensuring security, and defining complex business logic for our platform. Given the nature of our work—dealing with high-volume transaction processing, fraud detection, and sensitive financial data—Kamran's extensive experience and calm, thoughtful approach to problem-solving have been instrumental in keeping things running smoothly.
Feeling lucky to be working on such an innovative fintech product alongside someone with Kamran’s expertise. His ability to break down complex challenges, communicate clearly, and support the team has made a big difference in our progress.
What I appreciate most is that Kamran leads by example—he’s collaborative, always willing to share knowledge, and committed to writing clean, secure, and scalable code. I’ve learned a lot under his guidance and truly value the opportunity to work with him.
