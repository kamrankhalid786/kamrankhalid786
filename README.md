### Senior Backend Developer

I am a backend engineer with over 10 years of experience specializing in the design and implementation of scalable production systems. My core expertise lies in **PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)** and **Node.js**, with a deep focus on API architecture, microservices, and system maintainability.

Throughout my career, I have focused on solving complex business logic challenges, specifically in payment automation (PayByLink, webhooks), CRM onboarding workflows, and document management. I advocate for pragmatic engineering—prioritizing code that is performant, testable, and easy for teams to evolve.

### Technical Writing & Implementations
I believe that technical concepts are best understood through execution. I am currently working on a project to translate the architecture and patterns discussed in my [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@kamrankhalid06) into runnable code examples. 

These implementations, along with the **GT project**, are pinned below to demonstrate real-world applications of backend patterns, clean architecture, and robust error handling.

### Technical Focus
* **Core Stack:** PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), Node.js (TypeScript), Go.
* **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-driven systems, and API Gateway patterns.
* **Domains:** Payment gateway integrations, CRM workflows, and legacy system refactoring.
* **Speaking:** Technical speaker at events such as GDG Manchester, focusing on tech stack strategy and product development.
